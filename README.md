# BUET Alumni Portal

BUET Alumni Portal is implemented by [Saifur Rahman Jony](https://github.com/Srj/) and [Zaber Ibn Abdul Hakim](https://github.com/zaber666) for their CSE 216 Term Project (Session January 2020). This project was motivated by the idea to minimize the increasing gap among BUET Alumni and current students and build a solid connection among Alumni and current students for mutual development.



This Portal consists of 4 core modules:
* Users
* Post
* Community
* Events
